abbr: abbreviation
intro: is a website that ranks board games.

header_how_it_works: How it works.
paragraph_how_it_works: An algorithm takes a game and all of the game's reviews it can find. It then applies mathematics to these reviews to assign the game a number. That number doesn't have a meaning to itself but it can be used as an indicator of how "good" or "fun" the game is. The algorithm then does this scoring process for many-many games until it has a list of games with a number next to each title. When someone visits 100BG the website displays the most high-numbered games.

header_technical_details: Technical details. 
paragraph_technical_details: The scoring algorithm is as simple as calculating a lower bound of Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter. You can read more about it on {blogpost}. Most of the data here, including games, descriptions, pictures etc. is kindly provided by {bgg}. If you like board games you should check out their website as well. The code for Hundred Board Games will soon be available on {github}.
